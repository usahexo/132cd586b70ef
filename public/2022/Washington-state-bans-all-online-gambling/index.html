        <h1 id="Washington-state-bans-all-online-gambling"><a href="#Washington-state-bans-all-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Washington state bans all online gambling"></a>Washington state bans all online gambling</h1><p>Today, Washington state became the latest in a series of states to ban all forms of online gambling. The move comes after mounting pressure from the casino industry, which has been struggling in the face of increased competition from online gambling providers.</p>
<p>The ban will apply to all types of online gambling, including poker, casino games, and sports betting. It will go into effect on January 1st, 2018.</p>
<p>Washington is just the latest in a string of states to ban online gambling. Other states that have banned online gambling include Indiana, Louisiana, and Kansas.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-one-of-the-few-states-to-ban-online-gambling"><a href="#Washington-one-of-the-few-states-to-ban-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Washington one of the few states to ban online gambling"></a>Washington one of the few states to ban online gambling</h1><p>Washington was one of the first states to prohibit online gambling in 2006. At that time, very few states had any regulations regarding online gambling. Washington’s laws are unusual in that they do not make any distinctions between types of online gambling- all forms of online gambling are banned equally.</p>
<p>Supporters of the ban argue that online gambling is addictive and dangerous, and can lead to money laundering and other criminal activities. They also argue that it is unfair to regulate gambling differently based on how the game is played. For example, casino games like blackjack or poker can be played in person at a casino, or online, while bingo and slot machines can only be played at casinos.</p>
<p>Critics of the ban argue that it is unnecessary, because online gambling is already prohibited under federal law. They also argue that it is difficult to enforce, and that it has led to a black market for online gambling services.</p>
<p>Washington’s ban on online gambling has been in place for over a decade, and there have been no serious attempts to repeal it. However, in 2018 the US Supreme Court struck down a law prohibiting sports betting, which could pave the way for a challenge to Washington’s ban on online gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Online-gambling-is-illegal-in-Washington-due-to-money-laundering-concerns"><a href="#Online-gambling-is-illegal-in-Washington-due-to-money-laundering-concerns" class="headerlink" title="Online gambling is illegal in Washington due to money laundering concerns"></a>Online gambling is illegal in Washington due to money laundering concerns</h1><p>Washington is one of the states in the US that doesn’t allow any form of online gambling, and for good reason. The state’s law enforcement officials are concerned about the potential for money laundering through online gambling operations.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the Washington State Gambling Commission conducted a study on the potential for money laundering through online gambling and casinos. They determined that there was a significant risk for money laundering through these channels and launched an education campaign to raise awareness about the issue.</p>
<p>As part of this campaign, the commission created a new video to warn residents about the dangers of money laundering through online gambling. The video features interviews with representatives from the FBI, IRS, and Washington State Gambling Commission, who explain how money laundering works and how it can be used to fund criminal activity.</p>
<p>The commission also released a fact sheet on money laundering that provides more information about this issue. Money laundering is the process of disguising illegal funds so that they can be used legally. It’s often used to fund terrorist activities or other criminal ventures.</p>
<p>Online gambling can be a convenient way to launder money because it’s easy to hide your identity and transactions can be made anonymously. Transactions can also easily cross borders, making it difficult for law enforcement officials to track them down.</p>
<p>That’s why Washington has chosen to restrict online gambling operations in order to reduce the risk of money laundering. Law enforcement officials are working hard to crack down on illegal gambling operations, but it’s a challenging task given the global nature of the internet.</p>

<p>The move follows increasing concern over the rapid expansion of online gambling, which allows people to bet on sporting events, play casino games and bingo, and poker, via their phones or computers.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it is addictive and can lead to financial problems for people who bet more than they can afford to lose. They also warn that it can be used to launder money and finance terrorism.</p>
<p>In Washington, lawmakers voted unanimously to ban all forms of online gambling, including both poker and casino games. The bill now goes to Governor Jay Inslee for his signature.</p>
<p>Governor Inslee is expected to sign the bill into law, as he has previously voiced support for a ban on online gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Online-gambling-still-illegal-in-Washington-despite-recent-court-rulings"><a href="#Online-gambling-still-illegal-in-Washington-despite-recent-court-rulings" class="headerlink" title="Online gambling still illegal in Washington, despite recent court rulings"></a>Online gambling still illegal in Washington, despite recent court rulings</h1><p>__Despite two recent court rulings that deemed online gambling as legal in Washington state, the activity remains illegal according to the Washington State Gambling Commission (WSGC).</p>
<p>The rulings, which were handed down by King County Superior Court Judge David country in August and September, found that the 2006 law banning online gambling was unconstitutional. However, WSGC spokesperson Chris Stearns said that the commission will not change its interpretation of the law, which still considers online gambling to be illegal.</p>
<p>“The 2006 law is still the law of Washington state, despite the recent court rulings,” Stearns said. “Our interpretation of that law is that online gambling is illegal. So we would not expect any change in our enforcement posture as a result of those rulings.”</p>
<p>Stearns said that while the WSGC does not have any plans to actively enforce the law, it will investigate any complaints it receives about online gambling. He added that individuals who engage in online gambling could face civil and criminal penalties.</p>
<p>State Rep. Christopher Hurst, who sponsored the 2006 bill banning online gambling, said he plans to re-introduce a similar bill during the next legislative session.</p>
<p>“I am going to be reintroducing legislation come January to ban internet gambling again here in Washington state and hopefully get bipartisan support this time around,” Hurst said.</p>
<p>Hurst said he sponsored the bill because he was concerned about the negative effects of online gambling, including addiction and money laundering. He added that he was disappointed by the court rulings and hopes the legislature can pass a bill banning online gambling before it adjourns in March.</p>
