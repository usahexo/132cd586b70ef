After 55 years of existence, the Astros have finally won the World Series Championship with a dominant performance over the Dodgers.</p>
<p>The Astros started the series off strong by winning game one 7-6 in ten innings. They followed that up with an 8-0 shutout in game two to take a 2-0 series lead. The Dodgers bounced back with a 6-2 win in game three, but the Astros responded with another shutout in game four to take a 3-1 series lead.</p>
<p>The Dodgers had a chance to tie the series in game five, but the Astros bullpen was too much for them. Houston won 5-1 thanks to six innings of one run ball from starter Charlie Morton and three innings of scoreless relief from Brad Peacock, Chris Devenski, and Ken Giles.</p>
<p>The Astros clinched the title with a thrilling 5-3 victory in game seven. they got great pitching performances from Justin Verlander and Lance McCullers Jr., who both went six innings while allowing only three runs between them. The offense was led by George Springer, who hit two home runs and drove in five runs on the night.</p>
<p>This championship is especially meaningful for Houston fans given all that they have been through this year. The city was devastated by Hurricane Harvey, which caused massive damage and claimed dozens of lives. But through it all, the city has come together to support each other. And now, with the World Series title under their belt, the Astros have become the unifying force that Houston needs.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Houston Astros on their first ever World Series Championship!</p>
<h1 id="Astros-dominate-Dodgers-with-their-curveballs"><a href="#Astros-dominate-Dodgers-with-their-curveballs" class="headerlink" title="Astros dominate Dodgers with their curveballs"></a>Astros dominate Dodgers with their curveballs</h1><p>In the deciding game of the World Series, the Houston Astros dominated the Los Angeles Dodgers with their curveballs. They threw a total of 36 curveballs in the game, compared to only 25 fastballs.</p>
<p>This strategy was highly effective, as the Astros were able to get 11 strikeouts with their curveballs. In contrast, they only got two strikeouts with their fastballs.</p>
<p>The curveball is a particularly tricky pitch to hit, as it moves unpredictably in the air. This caused the Dodgers batters a lot of trouble, as they were repeatedly fooled by the curves thrown by Astros pitchers.</p>
<p>The Dodgers had actually been quite successful against curveballs during the regular season, but they were clearly not prepared for what the Astros threw at them in Game 7.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if other teams try to copy the Astros’ success with curveballs in future games.</p>
<h1 id="Justin-Verlander-comes-out-on-top-in-aces-match-up-against-Clayton-Kershaw"><a href="#Justin-Verlander-comes-out-on-top-in-aces-match-up-against-Clayton-Kershaw" class="headerlink" title="Justin Verlander comes out on top in aces match-up against Clayton Kershaw"></a>Justin Verlander comes out on top in aces match-up against Clayton Kershaw</h1><p>The Houston Astros opened their series against the Dodgers with a bang on Tuesday night, thanks to an outstanding performance from Justin Verlander. The former Cy Young and MVP winner outdueled reigning Cy Young and MVP Clayton Kershaw, leading the Astros to a 3-1 victory.</p>
<p>It was a pitcher’s duel from start to finish, as both Verlander and Kershaw were in top form. Verlander allowed just one run on three hits over seven innings, while Kershaw gave up two runs on six hits over seven innings.</p>
<p>In the end, it was Verlander who came out on top. He not only outpitched Kershaw, but he also hit a solo home run in the sixth inning that proved to be the difference in the game.</p>
<p>With the victory, the Astros improved to 9-2 on the season and extended their lead in the American League West to four games over the Mariners. The Dodgers, meanwhile, fell to 8-3 and saw their lead in the National League West shrink to two games over the Rockies.</p>
<h1 id="George-Springer-named-MVP-after-leading-Astros-to-World-Series-championship"><a href="#George-Springer-named-MVP-after-leading-Astros-to-World-Series-championship" class="headerlink" title="George Springer named MVP after leading Astros to World Series championship"></a>George Springer named MVP after leading Astros to World Series championship</h1><p>Houston Astros outfielder George Springer was named the Most Valuable Player of the 2017 World Series on Friday.</p>
<p>Springer, 29, batted .379 with five home runs and seven RBIs in the series as the Astros defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games. He also made several key defensive plays in Houston’s outfield.</p>
<p>“George Springer is the most deserving winner of the World Series MVP award that I can ever remember,” said Astros manager A.J. Hinch.</p>
<p>A first-round draft pick of Houston in 2011, Springer has blossomed into one of baseball’s top players. This season he hit .283 with 34 homers and 85 RBIs in 152 games.</p>
<p>In recognition of his MVP performance, Springer was presented with a large silver trophy and a $100,000 check from the Major League Baseball Players Association.</p>
<h1 id="Lance-McCullers-Jr-earns-series-MVP-honors-with-his-impressive-pitching"><a href="#Lance-McCullers-Jr-earns-series-MVP-honors-with-his-impressive-pitching" class="headerlink" title="Lance McCullers Jr. earns series MVP honors with his impressive pitching"></a>Lance McCullers Jr. earns series MVP honors with his impressive pitching</h1><p>Lance McCullers Jr. was the star of the show as the Astros completed their sweep of the Yankees in the ALCS. McCullers pitched brilliantly in all three games, earning him MVP honors for the series.</p>
<p>In Game 1, McCullers struck out seven batters while allowing just two runs over six innings. He followed that up with another strong performance in Game 2, holding the Yankees to one run over six innings while striking out eight batters. McCullers capped off his impressive series by once again limiting the Yankees to one run over six innings while striking out seven batters in Game 3.</p>
<p>McCullers’ performances were a big reason why the Astros are now heading to the World Series. He was dominant against a lineup that had been averaging 5.5 runs per game in the postseason. McCullers is now just the second pitcher ever to strike out seven or more batters in three consecutive postseason starts, joining Bob Gibson.</p>
<p>The Astros will need McCullers to continue pitching like this if they want to win their first World Series championship. He has already shown that he can dominate some of the best hitters in baseball, and he will need to stay sharp against teams like the Dodgers and Cubs.</p>
<p>McCullers is only 23 years old, and he has a lot of upside potential. He has already established himself as one of the top pitchers in baseball, and there is no telling how good he could become down the road.</p>
