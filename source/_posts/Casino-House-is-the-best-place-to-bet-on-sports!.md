#  Place your bets and watch the action LIVE at Casino House!

It's that time of year again where we all eagerly anticipate the biggest horse race in the world, the Grand National. Held every April at Aintree Racecourse in Liverpool, England, the race is a steeplechase with a total distance of 4 miles and 4 furlongs (7,142 metres).

There are 40 fences to be jumped during the race and it usually takes around 10 minutes to complete. The Grand National is open to horses aged four years and upward and there is a maximum field size of 30. The prize money for winning the race currently stands at £1 million.

In order to qualify for the Grand National, horses must have completed at least three races over obstacles and one of those races must be at least Grade 3 standard. The most famous fence on the course is called Becher's Brook and has been jumped by many legendary horses over the years, including Red Rum who won back-to-back Grand Nationals in 1973 and 1974.

So who is going to win this year's race? Well, that's difficult to say as it really depends on the weather conditions on the day and how well each horse handles the course. There are a few favourites though, including Vieux Lion Rouge who is currently priced at 9/1 with most bookmakers. Other contenders include Blaklion (10/1), One For Arthur (12/1) and Cause Of Causes (16/1).

If you're not able to make it down to Liverpool on Grand National day, don't worry as you can still watch all the action LIVE at Casino House!

There’s no mistaking the fact that sports and gambling go hand in hand. From the early days of horseracing, to modern-day sports betting, people have been trying to make a profit by betting on the outcomes of sporting events. And now, with the advent of online casinos, you can make those bets from the comfort of your own home.

 Casino House is one such online casino that offers a wide range of gambling options, including LIVE betting on a range of sports. So whether you’re into football, tennis or basketball, Casino House has you covered. And what’s even better is that you can make bets while the event is happening, so there’s no need to wait until the end of the game!

How does LIVE betting work?

Quite simply, LIVE betting allows you to place bets on events as they happen. This means that you can react to changes in the game and adjust your bets accordingly. For example, if team A is leading team B by two goals at halftime, you might want to bet on team A to win at the end of the game. However, if team A starts losing in the second half, you might want to switch your bet to team B winning instead.

The beauty of LIVE betting is that it allows you to take advantage of changing odds as the game progresses. So if one team looks like they’re going to win easily, their odds will be lower than if it’s a close match. Conversely, if one team looks likely to lose, their odds will be higher. This means that you can get better value for your money by taking advantage of favourable odds during a game.
