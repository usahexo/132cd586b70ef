#  Grizzlies Look to Griffin for Victory

The Memphis Grizzlies have been looking for a leader since Marc Gasol went down with an injury. Fans were hopeful that Tyreke Evans would fill that role, but he has not been able to do so. The Grizzlies are currently in eleventh place in the Western Conference and need to start winning games soon if they want to make it into the playoffs.

One player who may be able to lead the Grizzlies to victory is Blake Griffin. He is currently averaging 23 points, 7 rebounds, and 5 assists per game this season. He has proved himself as a leader on and off the court, and he may be just what the Grizzlies need to make a run for the playoffs.

Griffin is also known for his exceptional athleticism. He has the ability to jump high and perform powerful dunks that often result in him getting fouled. This can help get the crowd energized and give the Grizzlies a boost of momentum late in games.

The Grizzles will need to start playing better as a team if they want to win games with Griffin on their squad. They will also have to continue defending at a high level. If they can do these things, they may have a chance of making it deep into the playoffs this year.

#  Griffin Leads Grizzlies to Another Win

 Marc Gasol recorded his fifth double-double of the season with 18 points and 14 rebounds, as the Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Sacramento Kings 97-92. Mike Conley contributed 18 points and six assists, while Zach Randolph added 17 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. Rudy Gay led all scorers with 26 points on 10-of-19 shooting.

The Grizzlies (10-4) have now won seven of their last eight games, improving to 7-1 at home. The Kings (4-10) have dropped six of their last seven contests.

Memphis took an early lead and never looked back, building a 16-point advantage in the second quarter. However, Sacramento mounted a comeback in the third period, cutting the deficit to just four points heading into the fourth.

Randolph came up big down the stretch for Memphis, scoring eight points in the final period. He also nailed a crucial jumper with less than two minutes remaining that gave the Grizzlies a 95-90 lead.

Gay was magnificent for Sacramento throughout, but he was unable to carry his team to victory in the end. He scored 14 points in the fourth quarter, but it wasn't enough to overcome Memphis' balanced attack.

Conley praised Randolph's effort off the bench following the game: "Zach is huge for us - he gives us that extra push when we need it... He's been playing great basketball lately."

Gasol added: "We're starting to play better together... We're figuring out how to play off each other."

The Grizzlies will look to continue their winning streak on Wednesday night when they host James Harden and the Houston Rockets.

#  Grizzlies Ready to Take on the NBA Playoffs

The Memphis Grizzlies will begin their NBA Playoff campaign this weekend as they take on the Portland Trail Blazers. The Grizzlies are coming into the playoffs with a lot of momentum, having won seven of their last 10 games. This is in stark contrast to the Trail Blazers, who have lost six of their last 10 games.

Portland is heavily reliant on their star duo of Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. However, the Grizzlies have been able to shut these players down during the regular season, holding them to a combined 38 points per game on 29 percent shooting from the field. If Memphis can continue to frustrate Lillard and McCollum, they have a great chance at winning this series.

In addition to their stellar defense, the Grizzlies also have one of the best frontcourts in the NBA. Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph are both capable of scoring in double figures and grabbing rebounds at a high rate. This will be important against a Trail Blazers team that likes to run a lot of plays through their big men, LaMarcus Aldridge and Mason Plumlee.

If Memphis can continue to play well as a team and get contributions from all five players on the court, they should be able to advance past the first round of the playoffs.
