#  How to create a slot machine game Liga Nos 
Creating a slot machine game is not as difficult as it may seem. In this article, we will create a basic slot machine game in the Liga Nos football league.

We first need to create a simulation of a spinning reel. We will use the randome package to generate random numbers between 0 and 1. We can then use these numbers to determine which image should be displayed on the reel.

library(randome)
image <- matrix(c("A","B"), nrow=3, ncol=3)
values <- c(1,2,3)
reel_images <- cbind(image,values)

We can then create a function to display the reel images.
display_reel <- function(){
 matplot(reel_images[,1], type="l", ylab="Index", xlab="") 

 lines(reel_images[,2], col="red") 

 lines(reel_images[,3], col="green") 
}

Now we need to create a function to determine the outcome of the spin. We will use the rbinom() function in the stats package to generate a random number between 0 and 2. This number will represent whether the player has won or lost.
function get_result(){

 result <- rbinom(1, 1, .5) 

 if (result > 0.5){return("WON")} else {return("LOST")} }

Finally, we need to create our main game loop. We will start by initializing some variables. variable v contains the current value of our virtual money while variable w represents the amount of money we want to bet on each spin. We will also set variable p to 1 so that our game starts on the first reel. While v is greater than or equal to zero, we will keep looping through our game logic. In our game logic, we will first call get_result() to determine the outcome of the spin. If v has been lost, we will decrease it by w and end the loop. If v has been won, we will increase it by w and end the loop. Lastly if v is equal to zero, we will reset it back to its starting value and end the loop:
mainloop: do{

 v <-0 
 w <-10 

 p <-1 #set initial position on first reel 

 while (v >=0){

 get_result() #get result of spin 

 switch (get_result()) {

 case "WON": #win! v++w #increase v by w and go back to mainloop 
 case "LOST": #lose! v--w #decrease v by w and go back to mainloop  default: print("error") #something went wrong - stop running this code }

 p <-p + 1 #advance p one position on next reel }

 }while (v !=0)
