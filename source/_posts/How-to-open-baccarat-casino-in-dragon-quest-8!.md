#  How to open baccarat casino in dragon quest 8!

Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King, originally released for the PlayStation 2 in 2004, is one of the most successful and popular role-playing video games ever created. Now, over a decade later, the title is being remade for the Nintendo 3DS. This guide will show you how to open baccarat casino in dragon quest 8 so you can start enjoying some of the fantastic mini-games available there!

To access the baccarat casino, you will first need to have reached Chapter 2 of the game. Once you have done that, speak to the man named Pankraz in front of Swinedimples Academy. He will ask if you want to learn about baccarat, and if you agree to his offer, he will take you inside the casino.

Once inside, you will be able to participate in a few different mini-games. The first is roulette, which is pretty simple - just place your bet on the number or color that you think will come up and wait for the wheel to stop spinning. The second game is poker, which can be a bit more complicated but also more lucrative if you're good at it. The last game is blackjack, which is a bit like poker but with a few more rules.

The baccarat casino offers some great opportunities to make some extra money, but it's also a lot of fun just to play around in too. So be sure to check it out when you get a chance in Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King!

Dragon Quest 8 is a Japanese role-playing video game developed by Level-5 and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 2. The game was released in Japan in 2004, and in PAL regions and North America in 2005. As of March 31, 2009, the game has shipped over 3.2 million copies worldwide. A Nintendo 3DS remake was announced in January 2017 and released in September of the same year.

The story follows the Hero, a sixteen-year-old boy who is ordered by his father to compete in a baccarat tournament at Castle Roogna in order to prove his worthiness to succeed him as the king of Trodain. Along the way, he meets Medea, a young girl who joins his party and provides comic relief, and Yangus, a bandit who becomes his friend and ally. The group travels through several different countries, acquiring new party members along the way, before finally reaching their destination.

This article will reveal how to open baccarat casino in Dragon Quest 8! After you complete the events at Castle Roogna (which is right after beating both Lord Percy and The Dragon), go speak with King Trode outside his room. He’ll tell you about how he would like to see a casino opened here in Trodain – but since he doesn’t have enough money to fund it himself, he asks you to do it for him. Agree to this request and then head on over to the castle entrance where you’ll meet up with Yangus once again.

He’ll offer to help out with opening up the casino – but only if you can procure him an invitation from Yarra which will allow him entry into the place. To get this invitation, travel over to Murdaw’s lair (the final dungeon) and make your way through it until you reach the throne room. Here you’ll battle against Yarra – be sure not to kill her during the fight though as that’s not what we need! After defeating her she’ll give you the invitation that Yangus requested – so return back to Trodain Castle and show it to him.

With everything now set up, Yangus will open up the casino for you allowing access to all its games (baccarat is one of them). Be sure to take advantage of this place especially since it comes with some pretty sweet rewards!

Welcome to the Dragon Quest VIII: Casino Edition! This guide exists to help you open up the casino and start earning some big rewards.

In order to enter the casino, you'll need to complete a few simple tasks. Talk to Maribel and Ruff at the entrance to the casino - they'll ask for your help in retrieving a bag of tokens from a group of monsters inside. Slay the monsters and return to Ruff and Maribel to receive your reward: entry into the casino!

Now that you're inside, it's time to start gambling. In the baccarat casino, you can bet on either Player or Banker - whichever one you think will come out on top. You can also bet on a tie, which pays out at 8:1 odds.

Your first goal should be to earn some chips. The easiest way to do this is by playing the low stakes games offered in each of the casino's three rooms. In each room, there are several different games available, but most of them offer similar odds and payout structures.

In general, you'll want to play games that offer low risk and medium payouts. This will allow you to slowly build your chip stack while minimizing losses. With that in mind, some of the better bets in the baccarat casino include:

- betting on the banker when the player's hand totals 5 or less
- betting on a tie when both hands total 8 or 9
- betting on a player when their hand totals 6 or more

#  OHenry explains how to open baccarat casino in dragon quest 8

Dragon Quest 8 is a classic role-playing video game that was first released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 console. The game has since been ported to other platforms, including the Nintendo DS and Android/iOS devices. One of the most popular mini-games in Dragon Quest 8 is the casino, which allows players to gamble on various games of chance.

The casino can be accessed from the main menu once the party reaches the town of Baccarat. There are three games available for play: roulette, craps, and baccarat. In order to participate in a game, the player must first put up a bet. The minimum bet for each game is 200 gold coins, but higher bets are allowed.

There are three different ways to win at casino games in Dragon Quest 8: by obtaining a certain combination of numbers on the dice in craps, by getting a “natural” hand in baccarat, or by correctly guessing the outcome of a spin in Roulette. In addition, there are also three ways to lose: by failing to roll a certain combination of numbers on the dice in craps, by busting (going over 21) in blackjack, or by spinning a losing number in Roulette.

Roulette is the simplest casino game to play, as it simply involves betting on which slot a ball will end up in after spinning around a wheel. There are 36 slots on the wheel (18 red, 18 black), and players can bet on either red or black, odd or even, or any particular number. The payouts are as follows:

Red/Black: 1:1
Odd/Even: 1:1
Any Number: 35:1



Craps is more complicated than Roulette but offers better payouts if you know how to play it correctly. The aim of Craps is to roll certain combinations of numbers on two dice. The following table shows all possible combinations and their associated payouts:

2 & 12: 2:1  3 & 11: 2:1  4 & 10: 2:1  5 & 9: 5:2  6 & 8: 6:5


Baccarat is a card game where players bet on who will get closer to 9 points – the player, the banker, or a tie. Aces count as 1 point, 2 through 9 as face value, and 10 through King count as 0 points. The following table shows all possible outcomes and their associated payouts:
Player/Banker/Tie: 1:1
