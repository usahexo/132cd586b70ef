#  Legal online gambling coming to a state near you!

Almost all states have some type of legalized gambling - whether it be lotteries, Indian casinos, horse racing tracks, or state-run casinos. The only exception is Utah which bans nearly all types of gambling.

The expansion of legal gambling in the US has been fairly steady over the past few decades. New Hampshire was the most recent state to join the party when they legalized casino gambling in early 2019.

This trend is likely to continue in the coming years as more and more states look to legalize online gambling. There are a few reasons for this:

1) Online gambling is a major moneymaker. It's estimated that the global online gambling market will reach $59.8 billion by 2020.

2) Online gambling is convenient. You can gamble from the comfort of your own home, without having to leave town or spend money on travel costs.

3) Online gambling is safe. Compared to offshore casinos, American casinos are much safer since they are subject to stricter regulations.

4) Online gambling is addictive. This may not be a good thing, but it does mean that people are more likely to bet their money online than at a physical casino.

At the moment, only a handful of states have legalized online gambling: Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. But this number is expected to grow in the coming years as more and more states recognize the potential benefits of online gaming.

#  You can now legally gamble on your favorite sports team!

In a landmark decision, the US Supreme Court ruled on May 14th that individual states can now legalize sports betting. This has major implications for the multibillion-dollar gaming industry, as well as for the estimated $150 billion that is illegally wagered on sports in the United States each year.

While some states have already acted to legalize sports betting, including New Jersey, Delaware, Mississippi, and West Virginia, many others are expected to follow suit in the coming months and years. This move is being welcomed by many in the gaming industry, who see it as an opportunity to expand their businesses.

For consumers, the legalization of sports betting offers a number of benefits. First and foremost, it gives people a chance to legally gamble on their favorite sports teams. This can add an extra level of excitement to sporting events and provide a new way to make money.

 Additionally, legalizing sports betting could help to combat illegal gambling. By making sports betting legal and regulated, governments can better track and control gambling activity. This could help to reduce the amount of money that is lost to fraud and corruption each year.

Ultimately, the legalization of sports betting is a positive development for both consumers and businesses. It provides more options for consumers while also generating new revenue for state governments and the gaming industry. We can expect to see more legalized gambling in the years ahead as states look for ways to boost their economies.

#  Nevada legalizes online poker; other states to follow?

On October 13, 2017, Nevada became the first state in the US to legalize online poker. This is a major development in the ongoing effort by states to legalize and regulate internet gambling.

Nevada's legalization of online poker is seen as a test case for other states. It is hoped that this will pave the way for other states to legalize online poker, and eventually other forms of internet gambling.

The legalization of online poker in Nevada comes after years of debate and discussion on the issue. There have been concerns over the impact of online gambling on society, particularly with regards to addiction and money laundering. However, these concerns have been outweighed by the benefits of legalizing online poker.

The legalization of online poker in Nevada is expected to bring in millions of dollars in revenue for the state government. This will help to offset some of the costs associated with running legalized gambling in the state.

Nevada's decision to legalize online poker could pave the way for other states to follow suit. This could lead to a nationwide system of legalized internet gambling in the US.

#  Third circuit court of appeals strikes down federal ban on online gambling

In a landmark ruling on Tuesday, the third circuit court of appeals struck down the federal ban on online gambling, declaring it unconstitutional. The decision is a major victory for the casino industry and for consumers, who will now have access to a wider variety of games and betting options.

The court's opinion, written by Judge Thomas Hardiman, found that the federal law violates the Tenth Amendment by infringing on states' rights to regulate gambling within their borders. The law "unconstitutionally commandeers the states' police powers," Hardiman wrote.

This is not the first time that the third circuit has ruled against the federal gambling ban. In 2011, the court ruled that the law was unconstitutional as applied to poker websites. This latest ruling expands that finding to all forms of online gambling.

The federal government is likely to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. If the high court upholds the decision, it would mark a significant expansion of states' rights and could pave the way for broader legalization of online gambling.

#  State-by-state guide to legal gambling in America

Gambling is a popular pastime in the United States, with people betting on everything from horse races to the outcome of presidential elections. While gambling is legal in some form in most states, there are a few that have very restrictive laws.

In Nevada, casinos are allowed in every town, and sports betting is also legal. New Jersey recently legalized sports betting as well, and Delaware has a lottery.

Oregon was the first state to legalize gambling, back in 1989. There are no commercial casinos in the state, but there are tribal casinos and lottery games.

In California, casino gambling is only allowed in Native American casinos. The state does have horseracing and card rooms, and you can also bet on races taking place in other states.

Florida has both pari-mutuel wagering (on things like horse and dog races) and a state-run lottery. You can also bet on college and pro sports games, but only through licensed offshore sportsbooks.

Texas doesn't have any commercial or tribal casinos, but it does have racetracks where you can place bets on horse races. The Lone Star State also has a lottery.
