#  Poker Fans rejoice – unlimited online poker during the Soccer World Cup!

# Russia is the place to be for Soccer in June and July, and for Poker players too!

Russia is hosting the biggest soccer tournament in the world this summer, and PokerStars is making sure that fans of both sports can enjoy unlimited online poker action while they watch the games.

The World Cup kicks off on Thursday, June 14th, and runs through July 15th. That’s a whole lot of soccer action to take in, but where is the best place to watch it all? While you could certainly catch some of the games at a local bar or pub, we think that streaming them live on your computer or mobile device is the way to go. And what better way to do that than by playing some hands of poker at the same time?

Not only will PokerStars be offering continuous coverage of all 64 World Cup games, but we’ll also be running a range of special tournaments and promotions throughout the month-long tournament. So whether you’re rooting for England, Argentina, Germany or any other team, there’s no need to miss a minute of the action. And if you’re looking for some added excitement during particularly tense or exciting games, why not fire up a few hands of poker as well? You might just find yourself on a winning streak!

To get started, simply download the PokerStars software or Mobile app and click on the ‘World Cup’ tab. Here you’ll find everything you need to know about our World Cup schedule, including which games are being streamed and what special tournaments are taking place. And don’t forget – if you want to watch any game that isn’t being streamed live, we have a huge variety of On Demand videos available 24/7. So whether you want to catch all the action or just one particular game, PokerStars has got you covered.

#  PokerStars announces that players can compete in up to 10,000 simultaneous tournaments!

In what may be the largest tournament offering in online poker history, PokerStars has just announced that players can now compete in up to 10,000 simultaneous tournaments! The new Mega Tournaments tab, located in the PokerStars lobby, will allow customers to join any number of tournaments starting at the same time.

“We are always looking for ways to give our players the best possible experience and this new Mega Tournaments tab is another example of that commitment,” said Randy Bailey, Director of Poker at PokerStars. “Players can now join a huge variety of tournaments all at once, making it easy to find the game they are looking for.”

The Mega Tournaments tab offers a wide range of games including Texas Hold’em and Omaha cash games and tournaments as well as Sit & Go’s. Players have the choice of buy-ins starting at just $0.10 and going up to $1,000. The new tab also offers a range of stakes and formats to appeal to all types of players.

"This is an amazing development from PokerStars - one that will thrill both low-stakes grinders and high-roller enthusiasts alike," said professional poker player Jonathan Little. "There's something for everyone in this massive selection of tournaments!"
