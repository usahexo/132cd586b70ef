The smell of cigars and sweat fills the air as the Vegan Casino players take there seats at the table. The battle for the $10,000 prize has begun. 

Veganism is a lifestyle that excludes all animal products, including meat, dairy and eggs. Many people choose to go vegan for health reasons, while others do it for ethical reasons.

#  Which Casino Will Win the Vegan Showdown? 

It’s no secret that veganism is on the rise. From celebrities like Ariana Grande to everyday people, more and more people are swearing off meat, dairy, and eggs. This new way of living is great for the environment, for our health, and for the animals. But with so many different options out there, which vegan restaurant is the best?

That’s where the vegan showdown comes in. Recently, two of the biggest vegan chains in America – Veggie Grill and Blaze Pizza – announced they would be going head-to-head. Both chains are expanding rapidly, and both boast menu items that are sure to please vegans and non-vegans alike. So which chain will come out on top?

The answer may surprise you. While both chains have their pros and cons, Blaze Pizza ultimately takes the win. Here’s why:

1. The Menu Is More Varied

One of Blaze Pizza’s main selling points is its variety. Unlike Veggie Grill, which has a smaller menu with mostly burgers and sandwiches, Blaze Pizza offers a wide range of pizzas, salads, pastas, appetizers, and desserts. This means that there’s something for everyone at Blaze Pizza – even picky eaters!

2. It Offers Delivery

Do you live in a busy city with no time to cook? No problem! Blaze Pizza offers delivery so you can enjoy your pizza (or salad or pasta…) without ever having to leave your house.

3. You Can Customize Your Order

At Veggie Grill, you can only customize your order by adding or removing toppings. At Blaze Pizza, however, you can go beyond just toppings and choose from a variety of sauces, crusts, and cheeses. This means that you can create the perfect pizza just for you.

4. It Has A Cleaner Menu

Many people are turned off by vegan food because it can often be unhealthy and greasy. Not so with Blaze Pizza! All of its ingredients are fresh and healthy – no processed foods here! Plus, it cooks its pizzas in under three minutes in a high-temperature oven – meaning there’s little to no chance of cross contamination from animal products.

#  Who Will Prevail: Vegans or Vampires? 

As the world anxiously awaits the release of "Twilight Breaking Dawn – Part 2", the final chapter in the four-film series based on Stephenie Meyer's bestselling Twilight young adult vampire romance novels, some are wondering if Bella will finally choose between her love for Edward Cullen, a vampire, and her friendship with Jacob Black, a werewolf.

No matter which way Meyer decides to go, one thing is for sure: There will be blood. Lots of it.

There are already two distinct camps forming in anticipation of the movie's release. One is made up of Twilight fans who have followed the saga from its beginning and are rooting for Team Edward. The other camp is made up of vegans who are outraged that any film featuring vampires could be construed as promoting meat-eating.

In an interview with MTV News, vegan actress Ellen Page weighed in on the debate. "I think it would be really interesting if they made a vegan 'Twilight' movie," Page said. "I don't know how that would work, but I just think it would be awesome."

Page isn't the only one who thinks so. There is already a burgeoning vegan subculture within the Twihard fandom, with websites like VampireFreaks.com and VegansVSVampires.com espousing the ethical superiority of plant-based diets over blood-sucking ones.

So which side will prevail in this showdown? It may come down to numbers. According to a 2006 Harris poll, 3% of Americans identify themselves as vegetarians or vegans, while 43% say they are meat eaters. That means there are more than 14 times as many people who prefer to dine on dead animals as there are people who abstain from them altogether.

The majority has spoken, and it seems that vegans may be destined to always play second fiddle to vampires when it comes to popular culture icons. But that doesn't mean they can't win in other ways. In fact, there are several reasons why going vegan is a better choice than being a vampire – for your health, for the environment, and for the animals.

Health: A vegan diet is healthier than one that includes meat and dairy products. Vegans tend to have lower cholesterol levels and body mass indexes than meat eaters do, and they are less likely to develop heart disease, cancer or diabetes. They also have a reduced risk of getting food poisoning because meat and dairy products are major sources of foodborne illnesses.

Environment: Animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than all transportation combined – cars, buses, planes, trains, boats and submarines included. The factory farming system that provides most animal products is incredibly inefficient and wasteful, resulting in deforestation; water pollution from manure runoff; topsoil erosion; and displacement of local communities due to loss of land used for grazing and raising livestock feed crops.

Animals: If you're an ethical vegan – someone who believes that all sentient beings have a right to life – then eating animal products is out of the question. Chickens raised for eggs; pigs, cattle and sheep raised for meat; fish caught for human consumption; honey bees exploited for their honey; these are all individuals whose lives are taken every day so that humans can indulge in their taste for flesh or secretions derived from their bodies . . . without regard for their feelings or interests whatsoever

#  Battle of the Bloodsuckers: Vegans vs Vampires at the Grand Victoria Casino

In a matchup of two iconic creatures, vegans battle vampires this week at the Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin, Illinois. The vegan side is led by PETA spokesperson and television personality Alicia Silverstone, while the vampires are represented by “Twilight” author Stephenie Meyer.

The event is part of PETA’s campaign to show that veganism is the healthiest way to live. According to Silverstone, “A vegan diet is the key to preventing heart disease, cancer, and other diseases. It’s also great for the environment and helps animals.”

Meyer counters that her vampires are misunderstood creatures who only drink animal blood because they can’t get their nutritional needs met any other way. “Vampires are actually quite healthy when they eat a balanced diet of animal blood and fruit juice,” she says.

The debate is sure to be heated, but in the end, there can only be one winner. Who will it be? The vegans with their strong message of compassion and health? Or the vampires with their mysterious allure and claims of being misunderstood? Only time will tell!
