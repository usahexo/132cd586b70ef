## What is Robux?

Robux is an in-game currency that can be used to purchase a variety of items in Roblox. You can use your Robux to buy shirts, hats, gear, and other virtual items for your character. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can also use Robux to purchase game passes and more.

To get started, open the Robux section of the main menu. Here, you can see how many Robux you have and how many you need to purchase the item you want. Select the amount of Robux you want to spend and then click Purchase.

If you don’t have enough Robux to purchase the item outright, don’t worry. You can choose to pay for it over time by selecting the Use Coins button at the bottom of the screen. This will allow you to use your Coins (another in-game currency) to pay for the item over time.
