# What is the Other Name for 7 Card Blackjack?

Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is one of the most popular casino card games in the world. The game is played with a deck of 52 cards and the objective is to beat the dealer by having a hand that is worth more points than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21 points.

One variation of blackjack that is less commonly known is 7 card blackjack. As the name suggests, the game is played with seven cards instead of the usual two. This gives players more opportunities to make strong hands and win big.

7 card blackjack is also known as "Seven Card Charlie". A Seven Card Charlie is a hand that consists of seven cards, which do not exceed a total point value of 21. This hand is very rare but when it does occur, it beats all other hands, including a blackjack.

In regular blackjack, the dealer usually has a house edge of around 0.5%, which means that the player will lose, on average, 50 cents for every $100 that they wager. However, in 7 card blackjack, the house edge can vary depending on the rules of the specific game being played. Some casinos offer games with a lower house edge than regular blackjack, which can make it a more attractive option for players looking to win big.

To play 7 card blackjack, the rules are similar to regular blackjack, with a few key differences. The dealer will deal seven cards face up to each player, and then seven cards face down to themselves. The player will then make their best hand using any combination of the seven cards they were dealt. The objective is still to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21 points.

In conclusion, 7 card blackjack, or Seven Card Charlie, is a variation of blackjack that gives players more opportunities to make strong hands and win big. While it is not as popular as regular blackjack, it is still played in some casinos and can offer a lower house edge, depending on the specific rules being used.
